# MobileApps

I thought of making a Cooking Book App, in which you could check out recipes put on the app by other people, save them , give them a rating or even put your own recipes on, being able to delete them or edit them later.All of the recipes will be viewable in a list, seperated in different categories, making it easy to search for any of the users desires. For each item in the list it will display: the name, the difficulty of making it and the rating.
